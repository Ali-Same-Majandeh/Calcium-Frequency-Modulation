# 1. Introduction

The **Model.ipynb** is a python notebook that contains the numerical solution of a system of ordinary differential equations developed in **"A dynamic model of calcium frequency modulation by mitochondrial superoxide"** available at BioRxiv: sd.com


# 2. Prerequisites to run the code

1. **Python3** (Can be Installed from python.org. Ensure to **"Add Python to PATH"**)
2. Four python packeges:
    - **numpy**
    - **scipy**
    - **matplotlib**
    - **notebook**

All python packages can be installed by running this script in cmd or terminal:
`pip install [package-name]`

for example:
`pip install numpy`

# 3. How to run the code

After installing all packages, first run the **notebook** from cmd:
`C:\Users\user1> notebook`

Then go to the folder containing **Model.ipynb** then open it.

Run the code by clicking ***Play Botton***

# 4. Output

Running the code takes 1-5 minutes and yields the below image:
