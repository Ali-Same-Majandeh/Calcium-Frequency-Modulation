# 1. Introduction


The **Model.ipynb** notebook provides a numerical solution to a system of ordinary differential equations developed in the study:  
**"A dynamic model of calcium frequency modulation by mitochondrial superoxide"**  
Available on bioRxiv: [doi.org/10.1101/2025.07.28.667258](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.07.28.667258)

This simulation explores how mitochondrial superoxide influences calcium dynamics through a proposed frequency modulation mechanism.
